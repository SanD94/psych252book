# Introduction {#intro}

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods).

Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.


```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].

```{r stats-help, fig.cap='Stats cheatsheet',fig.align='center',echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('figures/cheatsheets/stats-help.jpg') 
```

See figure \@ref(fig:stats-help)


```{r klippy, echo=FALSE, include=TRUE}
klippy::klippy()
```

## General points 

- You will have software to help you with computation, but model specification and interpretation will be up to you.
- Motivation in first lecture: [tidyverse philosophy](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#what-you-will-learn)

## To do list 

- have a separate chapter on organization? 
  + information about how I run code (with code sections)
  + use temporary variable names and delete at the end of a code section
  + save the outputs of more intensive computations as RData 
  + how to structure code
- use normal plotting functions as well? `hist()`, `plot()`, nice way of showing distributions
- teach meta skills: 
  + how to navigate all the R packages? (shiny apps for searching)
  + which packages to use (make sure it's up to date)
  + the structure of a CRAN page
- installing R:
  + set a permanent location for the R packages in the environment variable
- general rules for typesetting: 
  - only use lower case 
  - use "." for structure: 
    - data frames: df.
    - lists: l.
    - functions: fun.
    - model fits: fit.
    - temporary variables: tmp.
  - otherwise use "_" for names
