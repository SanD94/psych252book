@article{gelman2000type,
	Abstract = {In classical statistics, the signi cance of comparisons (e.g., 1 ? 2) is calibrated using the Type 1 error rate, relying on the assumption that the true di erence is zero, which makes no sense in many applications. We set up a more relevant framework in which a true comparison can be positive or negative, and, based on the data, you can state \textbackslash{} 1 {$>$} 2 with con dence," \textbackslash{} 2 {$>$} 1 with con dence," or \textbackslash{}no claim with con dence." We focus on the Type S (for sign) error, which occurs when you claim \textbackslash{} 1 {$>$} 2 with con dence" when 2 {$>$} 1 (or vice-versa). We compute the Type S error rates for classical and Bayesian con dence statements and nd that classical Type S error rates can be extremely high (up to 50\%). Bayesian con dence statements are conservative, in the sense that claims based on 95\% posterior intervals have Type S error rates between 0 and 2.5\%. For multiple comparison situations, the conclusions are similar.},
