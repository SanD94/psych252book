@article{burkner2019ordinal,
	Abstract = {Ordinal variables, although extremely common in psychology, are almost exclusively analyzed with statistical models that falsely assume them to be metric. This practice can lead to distorted effect-size estimates, inflated error rates, and other problems. We argue for the application of ordinal models that make appropriate assumptions about the variables under study. In this Tutorial, we first explain the three major classes of ordinal models: the cumulative, sequential, and adjacent-category models. We then show how to fit ordinal models in a fully Bayesian framework with the R package brms, using data sets on opinions about stem-cell research and time courses of marriage. The appendices provide detailed mathematical derivations of the models and a discussion of censored ordinal models. Compared with metric models, ordinal models provide better theoretical interpretation and numerical inference from ordinal data, and we recommend their widespread adoption in psychology.},

@article{wagenmakers2010bayesiana,
	Abstract = {In the field of cognitive psychology, the p-value hypothesis test has established a stranglehold on statistical reporting. This is unfortunate, as the p-value provides at best a rough estimate of the evidence that the data provide for the presence of an experimental effect. An alternative and arguably more appropriate measure of evidence is conveyed by a Bayesian hypothesis test, which prefers the model with the highest average likelihood. One of the main problems with this Bayesian hypothesis test, however, is that it often requires relatively sophisticated numerical methods for its computation. Here we draw attention to the Savage\textendash{}Dickey density ratio method, a method that can be used to compute the result of a Bayesian hypothesis test for nested models and under certain plausible restrictions on the parameter priors. Practical examples demonstrate the method's validity, generality, and flexibility.},

@article{gelman2000type,
	Abstract = {In classical statistics, the signi cance of comparisons (e.g., 1 ? 2) is calibrated using the Type 1 error rate, relying on the assumption that the true di erence is zero, which makes no sense in many applications. We set up a more relevant framework in which a true comparison can be positive or negative, and, based on the data, you can state \textbackslash{} 1 {$>$} 2 with con dence," \textbackslash{} 2 {$>$} 1 with con dence," or \textbackslash{}no claim with con dence." We focus on the Type S (for sign) error, which occurs when you claim \textbackslash{} 1 {$>$} 2 with con dence" when 2 {$>$} 1 (or vice-versa). We compute the Type S error rates for classical and Bayesian con dence statements and nd that classical Type S error rates can be extremely high (up to 50\%). Bayesian con dence statements are conservative, in the sense that claims based on 95\% posterior intervals have Type S error rates between 0 and 2.5\%. For multiple comparison situations, the conclusions are similar.},
