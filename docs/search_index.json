If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2018) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). Figure 1.2: Stats cheatsheet See figure 1.2 1.1 Resources Advanced R by Hadley Wickham 1.2 General points You will have software to help you with computation, but model specification and interpretation will be up to you. 1.3 To do list have a separate chapter on organization? information about how I run code (with code sections) use temporary variable names and delete at the end of a code section save the outputs of more intensive computations as RData how to structure code use normal plotting functions as well? hist(), plot(), nice way of showing distributions teach meta skills: how to navigate all the R packages? (shiny apps for searching) which packages to use (make sure itâ€™s up to date) the structure of a CRAN page installing R: set a permanent location for the R packages in the environment variable References "]
